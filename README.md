## Overview
The goal of this project is to help me learn and test concepts around Godot 2D multiplayer. This utilizes the [SteamMultiplayerPeer](https://github.com/GodotSteam/GodotSteam/releases/tag/v4.6-mp) from [GodotSteam](https://godotsteam.com/) so be sure to load the project with that version of the Godot editor or errors will happen.
